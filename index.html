<h1>Practicing ON New GITZ</h1>
<p>I’m Waniya, and I’ve recently started practicing new Git commands to improve my version control skills. By working with Git, I’m learning how to manage projects more effectively, track changes, collaborate with teams, and keep my code organized. Exploring features like branching, merging, commits, and push/pull has given me hands-on experience in real-world project workflows. Practicing Git not only strengthens my technical skills but also prepares me for teamwork in software development environments.</p>
